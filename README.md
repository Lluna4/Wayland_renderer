To compile use this command `gcc main.c xdg-shell-protocol.c -lwayland-client libgame_lib.a` (first you have to compile the game library, do it like any cmake project (`mkdir build && cd build`, `cmake ..`,`cmake --build .`)) you have to have wayland development stuff install, usually it has the name `wayland-devel` in a package manager
